# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This is my first application.

I used :
- React Native
- Reat Navigation
- React Native Paper
- Async Storage
- Axios
- Bottom Sheet from <a href='https://github.com/gorhom'/>Gorhom</a>


  For now, I don't use the backend ( MongoDB/ Firebase/ AWS) because I don't understand the process but I will implement this feature soon.
